# parse engineData

Adobe thought it would be cool to create their own markup language for text data embedded within a Photoshop document. I've taken the liberty of calling it EngineData since that is the name used in the descriptor embedded within PSD files. This is a general purpose parser for that data.

Maybe you know [https://github.com/layervault/psd-enginedata](https://github.com/layervault/psd-enginedata)

This is a javascript achieve. Need iconv-lite, beacuse the text. 

## Usage
	var fs = require('fs');
	var parseEngineData = require('./parseEngineData');
	
	fs.readFile('./enginedata', function(err, res){
	    var r = parseEngineData(res);
	    console.log(r);
	})
